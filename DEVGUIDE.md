# Development Setup

If you use Nix, drop into a shell with all dependencies:

```bash
nix-shell
```

Then use the Makefile to set up and work with the project:

```bash
make install   # create venv and install in editable mode
make test      # run the test suite
make clean     # remove venv and build artifacts
make help      # list all available targets
```
